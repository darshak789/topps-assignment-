In two separate incidents in Surat, 
a porter’s licence was cancelled after 
he pressed the emergency button of a Vande Bharat train, 
delaying it by 10 minutes and a ticket checker was suspended 
after vigilance officers found excess money in his possession.

As per details from sources at the Surat railway station,
 on November 7, Gabbar Singh, 35, a porter and a resident of Surat,
  carried the luggage of an elderly person to a Vande Bharat train on platform number 1. 
  However, he could not alight on time and the automatic doors closed.

Singh tried to open the door but couldn’t so he pressed the emergency button and
 alighted the train after it came to a halt.
